# Client app for Buoy
A search engine for consumers to find businesses they want to believe in.

----
This app started life as boilerplate from `preact-cli`, so the following terminal commands are baked 
## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy 
npm run test
```
